# Aneurysm-Phantom-Fabrication

This project focuses on **fabricating lifelike aneurysm models** for **in-vitro blood flow experiments**, particularly for **Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) studies**. The challenge was to develop **soft, flexible, and optically clear phantoms** that **accurately replicate human arteries**.  

Using **3D printing and silicone casting**, we transformed **real patient-specific aneurysm geometries** into **transparent, experimental-ready models**, making it possible to analyze blood flow dynamics under controlled conditions.  

### **Why This Study?**  
- **Silicone 184 Elastomer** provided **exceptional optical clarity**, making it **ideal for PIV flow visualization**.
